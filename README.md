# MetaHDR
Single Shot High-dynamic Range Imaging and Sensing Using a Multifunctional Metasurface
### Introduction

### Usage
If you want to simulate the lens surface and profile, please make sure you have successfully installed DFlat before downloading our code, which can be done via
```
pip install dflat_opt
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/DeanHazineh/DFlat
pip install -e .
```
Then you can use our code, e.g., reconstruct a HDR image, by
```
git clone https://github.com/guo-research-group/MetaHDR
cd MetaHDR
python HDRreconstruction.py
```
